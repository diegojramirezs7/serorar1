The implementations for the JAX-RS methods are in the src/main/java/de/uniba/dsg/jaxrs/resources. 

There's a Resource file for each interface: ArtistApi -> ArtistResource.java, AlbumApi -> AlbumResource.java, 
PlaylistApi - > PlaylistResource.java.

Each of these resource files implement their given interface and contain the required methods.
